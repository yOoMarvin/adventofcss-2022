## ðŸŽ„ Advent of CSS

As the year comes to a close, I'd like to brush up on my CSS skills and improve them a bit. Therefore I take part in the [Advent of CSS](https://www.adventofcss.com/) and will create my challenges here in this repository.

However, I will approach the challenge a little differently and work with my favorite toolstack from Next.js and TailwindCSS. Primarily this project should fulfill an educational purpose.
